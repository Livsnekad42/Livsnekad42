# Frontend React & Next.js & Web3 Developer

Frontend Developer — React & Next.js & Web3

Building clean, efficient, and maintainable interfaces for modern web applications.
Focused on React, Next.js, and scalable frontend architecture.

### 🪙 About
Frontend developer with a versatile background across multiple state-management patterns, UI frameworks, and backend ecosystems.
I’ve worked with both classic and modern React stacks — from Redux / Redux-Saga / MobX to Zustand / TanStack Query — which helps me adapt quickly to different codebases and team standards.

I value predictable architecture, clear data flow, and robust tooling.
Strong experience with Python (FastAPI, Django) enables me to work effectively across frontend–backend boundaries.

### 🧠 Currently Working On
Exploring React Native by [building a personal project](https://github.com/Livsnekad42/dating_reactnative_demo) — a Tinder-style mobile app to deepen understanding of navigation, gesture handling, and mobile-first component patterns.

### 🧭 Vision
Modern products demand interfaces that balance performance, clarity, and reliability.
I aim to create frontend architectures that scale well, remain easy to maintain, and stay clear for both developers and users.
